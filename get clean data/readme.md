* Download and Unzip data file.

## How the script works

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 

* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
